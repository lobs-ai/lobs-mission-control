/// Tests for command palette dismissal performance
///
/// **Issue Fixed:** Command palette felt slow to dismiss when executing navigation commands
/// (especially "Home") because the action was executed BEFORE or DURING the palette dismissal
/// animation, causing heavy view updates to interfere with smooth animation.
///
/// **Solution:** Dismiss palette first with animation (0.25s), then execute the action AFTER
/// the animation completes (0.3s delay). This ensures the dismissal animation is completely
/// smooth and uninterrupted by any view updates.
///
/// **Performance Pattern:**
/// - Close palette: immediate (animated over 0.25s)
/// - Execute action: 0.3s delay (AFTER animation completes)
/// - Reset state: 0.35s delay (after action starts)
///
/// **Key Learning:** When dismissing overlays, always prioritize the dismissal animation
/// over executing expensive actions. A 100ms delay in action execution is imperceptible
/// to users, but janky animations are immediately noticeable.
